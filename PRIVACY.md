# Privacy Policy for Better Lyrics

**Last Updated:** October 4, 2025

Thank you for using Better Lyrics! This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our browser extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## 1. Introduction

Better Lyrics is an open-source browser extension that enhances the Youtube Music experience with features like time-synced lyrics and an improved user interface. Our goal is to provide these features while collecting the minimum amount of information necessary.

## 2. Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information to provide and improve our service:

### 2.1. Information Collected Automatically

When you use Better Lyrics, we automatically collect certain information that your browser sends with every request. This includes:

* **IP Address:** Your IP address is automatically sent with every request as part of standard internet protocol - this is necessary for our servers to send lyrics back to your browser. We only use it temporarily for security purposes (rate limiting, authentication and abuse prevention). Your IP address is *not* permanently stored and is automatically deleted from our logs after a maximum of 7 days.
* **User-Agent:** Your browser's user-agent string, which includes information about your browser type, version, and operating system. This helps us debug issues and understand our user base. Your User-Agent is *not* permanently stored and is automatically deleted from our logs after a maximum of 7 days.
* **Song Metadata:** To fetch lyrics, we send the song name, artist name, album name, and the Youtube video ID to our API.

### 2.2. Information You Provide to Us

We do not have user accounts and do not require you to provide any personal information to use Better Lyrics.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

* **To Provide and Maintain the Service:** We use song metadata to fetch lyrics from our own and third-party sources. We use your IP address to send the lyrics back to you.
* **For Debugging and Development:** We log API requests for up to 7 days to monitor the health of our service, troubleshoot issues, and for development purposes. After 7 days, this data is deleted, and only aggregated, anonymized analytics data is retained.
* **For Security and Abuse Prevention:** We use information such as your IP address to protect our API from abuse and to ensure the security and stability of our service.

## 4. Information We Share

We do not sell, rent, or lease your personal information. We only share information in the following circumstances:

* **With Third-Party Service Providers:** We use third-party services to provide our service. These services have their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.
  * **Cloudflare:** We use Cloudflare for our API infrastructure, including Cloudflare Workers for observability and Cloudflare Turnstile for security. You are subject to Cloudflare's Privacy Policy.
  * **LRCLib:** By default, Better Lyrics will fetch lyrics from LRCLib as a fallback source. You can disable this feature in the extension settings. When this feature is enabled, you are subject to LRCLib's privacy standards.
* **To Fetch Lyrics:** We may forward song metadata (song name, artist name, album name, video ID) to third-party APIs to search for lyrics. We do not send any personal information to these third parties.

## 5. Third-Party Services

Better Lyrics uses the following third-party services:

* **Cloudflare:** For API hosting, analytics, and security. You can find their privacy policy here: [https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/)
* **LRCLib:** As an optional, fallback source for lyrics. You can find their privacy information here: [https://lrclib.net/](https://lrclib.net/)

## 6. Data Retention

We retain API request logs, which include your IP address and other information sent with the request, for a maximum of 7 days for debugging and development purposes. After this period, only aggregated and anonymized data, which cannot be correlated to a specific user, is saved.

## 7. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

## 8. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, such as the right to access, correct, or delete the personal data we hold about you. As we do not have user accounts and only store logs for a short period, the personal information we hold is limited. If you have any questions about your rights, please contact us.

## 9. Children's Privacy

Better Lyrics is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information.

## 10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
